$// iBus2PPM v2 version 1.01
// Arduino Nano/Pro code to read FlySky iBus and output
// x channels of CPPM, and x channels of PWM.
// BaseFlight supports iBus, CleanFlight got it, and even betaflight.
// But since iBus is 115k2 serial, it requires an UART, sacrificing the ability to
// use GPS on the NAZE32.
// Another use for this is as a link to a 433MHz radio Tx
//          FlySky i6 (with 10 channel patch) -> iA6B -> iBus2PPM -> 433MHz LRS
// Nobody wants to use trainer cable if they can run wireless.

// I use Turnigy TGY-i6 aka Flysky FS-i6 transmitter and iA6B Rx. I am running hacked firmware from
// this thread to get 10 channels over iBus: http://www.rcgroups.com/forums/showthread.php?t=2486545
// the i6 has the 4 channels for the sticks, 4 switches, and 2 analog potentiometers. So can generate
// 10 independent channels.
// Latest hacked firmware allow to combine 2 switches to one 4 or 6 channel switch, which I use for flight modes,
// thus I get only 9 channels (could make channel 10 a derived channel).
// As a result, I device to send only 9 channels over PWM.
// Unfortunately, there is no way to input high channels in trainer mode yet. Would be nice for head-tracker.

#define PPM_CHANS 8   // The number of iBus channels to send as PPM. 14 is supported. 10 from FS-i6
					 // No reason to send more than the FC will need.
#define PWMS 3        // We want to output 3 channels on PWM - Max is likely 4. Possible 6 (not tested)
// Both arrays below must be at least PWMS entries long.
uint16_t pwmChan[] = { 7, 8, 9 }; // The channels to put on the PWM pins. My Flight Controller uses 1..6. So I output 7-9
	// the VrA + VrB can be used to control pan/tilt.

// The pins to output PWM on. Only use PWM enabled pins
// Pins 9+10 seems to use timer OC1A+OC1B, which we use for PPM, so using
// these could break PPM. 5+6 Runs at 1KHz refresh, the others ~490Hz.
uint16_t pwmPins[] = { 5, 6, 3, 11, 9, 10 };

		// PPM_FrLen can be adjusted down for faster refresh. Must be tested with PPM consumer (Flight Controller)
		// PPM_VariableFrames uses variable frame length. I.e. after writing channels, wait for PPM_Pause, and then next packet.
		// Would work as long as PPM consumer uses level shift as trigger, rather than timer (standard today).
		// 8 channels could go from 22500 us to an average of 1500 (center) * 8 + 3500 = 15500 us. That is
		// cutting 1/3rd off the latency.
